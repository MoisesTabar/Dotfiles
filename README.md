## Dotfiles

A collection of my personal dotfiles.

### Try it out
Don't forget to delete or move your current nvim directory when using this repo neovim config

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:MoisesTabar/Dotfiles
```

Run nvim and wait for all the plugins to be installed

### Check the health of neovim
Open neovim and enter the following

```bash
  :checkhealth
```

You should install the necessary supports for your needs, example: Python, Npm, Ruby, etc...

### TODO

- Windows Powershell PS1 Configuration
- ZShell Configuration
